FMAPB2 version 1.0, released on 03/29/2024

This version has a small change from the version published in 2019. In the 2019 version, the cutoff distance, r_cut, for calculating 
interaction energies between atomic pairs was set to 36 Å. In this release, r_cut is increased to three times the Debye screeening length 
when that value is below 36 Å. This increase ensures that r_cut is at least three times the Debye length, and is important for low ionic 
strength.
