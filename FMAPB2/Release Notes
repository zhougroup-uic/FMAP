FMAPB2 version 1.0, released on 03/29/2024

This version has a small change from the version published in JPCB (2019). In the 2019 version, the cutoff distance, r_cut, for calculating 
interaction energies between atomic pairs was set to 36 Å. In this release, r_cut is increased to three times the Debye screening length 
when that value is below 36 Å. This increase ensures that r_cut is at least three times the Debye length, and is important for low ionic 
strength.

This change in calculating the pair interaction and running fmapb2 in command line are described in bioRxiv (2024).
