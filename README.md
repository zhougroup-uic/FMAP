# FMAP

This folder contains codes written using the FMAP approach. FMAP stands for fast Fourier transform-based modeling of atomistic protein-protein interactions. Specializations include:

FMAPB2: for calculating the second virial coefficient

FMAPSq: for calculating the strucutre factor measured by small-angle scattering

See the subdirectories for details.
